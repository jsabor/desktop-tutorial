# Welcome to my quick Github tutorial.

There are many places to find these commands, I learned this through a LinkedIn Learning course "Learning GitHub" By Aaron Stewart. Purpose of this repo is simply I wanted a singluar place to walk through the commands for VSC.

For tips on Command Line go here: https://github.com/jsabor/desktop-tutorial/blob/main/Command_Line_Steps.md

Steps assume you are using the terminal commands in an IDE like Visual Studio Code and authentication, as well as, Git command line commands are installed. Checkout https://git-scm.com/downloads to download or for Mac users, use Homebrew command `$brew install git`.

For cloning authentication, checkout https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories#cloning-with-https-urls
